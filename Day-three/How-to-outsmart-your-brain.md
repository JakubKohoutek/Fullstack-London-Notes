# How to outsmart your own brain

Question "What did you like so far?" activates so called Working sets => our brain can hold to plus minus 5 items at top and is swapping the items. Good questions to activate the brain are:

* Tell me something interesting
* Can't remember? Start with something trivial

=> Put customers in the "right frame of mind"

## Your brain is lying to you

There is about 100ms delay before any input reach the consciousness, therefore applications should respond in under 100ms to user input.

? ***Create arduino machine to test the delay***

### Usage

* Use animation /  sound to lead users
* Experiment with techniques to reduce **perceived** loading time
* Use animated placeholders before the real data loads
* Use loader that slows down exponentially :)

## Your eyes are lying to you

We see only 4.5 degree angle sharply, everything else we see blured and it's our brain that buffers what's there.
Our eyes are set to see edges of things, not fills.

* Google Photos take advantage of this and display pixelated images until it loads them

Our brain is predicting and if it predicts something wrong, then that's where learning happens.

## How tho learn things easier

* Unit testing as a learning tool => write unit test and try to write a code later. Great and fast way to learn a new programming language
* Start with something you know and build up => our brain likes small adjustments and additional information, it doesn't like to learn big thing at once as it is energetically demanding. Reading the whole documentation of some language at once doesn't work, we should learn what we need specifically, bit by bit.
* Learning is sensitive to emotion => **find what's relevant to you**

## General tips when teaching

* Ask "Where do people get this wrong?" not "Tell me all about this"
* Give people realistic environments
* Activate the right working set first
