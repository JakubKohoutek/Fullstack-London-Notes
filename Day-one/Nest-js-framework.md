# NestJS: A Framework for Your Node Backend

Samuel Roz√©

@samuelroze

Nest is basically an MVC framework based on new ES features and types.

The obvious reasons to use a framework:

* Don't need to reinvent the wheel
* Easier to integrate with other libraries
* Maintained by a community

Not that obvious reasons:

* It has some documentation
* It provides some constraints/patterns
* Opportunity for the team to contribute to open-source
  * Brings motivation
  * Brings visibility for the company

```bash
npm install -g @nestjs/cli
```

I gave up taking notes, too complicated and fast at the same time.

? ***Check out CQRS***
